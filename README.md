# GetQuorum Technical Assessments

Congratulations!

If you've made it this far then you're an awesome candidate. The next step is for you to complete some assessments of your technical abilities. These short tests are centered around common tasks you'll encounter at GetQuorum. Each test is designed to be short - about 15 minutes or less per test.

If you're not a candidate and have just stumbled onto this page, then you're awesome too. Give these tests a try for fun (if you're into that sort of thing).

## Test Instructions

Each folder contains an Excel (`.xlsx`) file test along with a README file with specific instructions (and hints) for that test. You will be asked to download the `.xlsx` file, make the changes to the file contents as instructed, and then email the completed `.xlsx` test files to us.

## Sending the completed tests back to us

Send and email with all the completed test files attached to:

- **to:** careers[AT]getquorum.com (replace the [AT] with @)
- **subject:** "Completed Tests for [Your Name] (replace [Your Name] with your name)"

## What happens after I send the tests in?

We'll review your tests and then contact you for an in-person interview. We'll ask you questions about how you completed your test, and we may ask you to complete another short test during the interview as well.
