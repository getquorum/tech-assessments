# Test #3 - The In-person Assessment

In this assessment you will be tasked with matching data between lists and breaking out long strings. It's a combination of the concepts from Tests 1 and 2. 

There's no test file to work on, instead we'll conduct the assessment in person at our offices. You'll use your knowledge from completing the previous tests to describe how you'd go about solving this one.

### To help you prepare

The image below shows you an example of the test file we'll be working with.

The file will once again contain two lists. The first list will have `unit`, `name`, and missing `fee` & `mailing address` information.  The second list will contain the matching `fee` and `address` information.

### Your job will be to...

- add the missing `fee` and `mailing address` data to the first list using the matching data from the second list. 
- break out the `mailing address` data into it's individual address parts.
- sort the results and remove entries that don't have matching data

The image below is an example of what the final results should look like.

### Hints and notes

- If you've completed the previous two tests then you're 90% of the way there
- Look into the `(Advanced)` hints from the previous two tests
- Look into how to **sort** and **filter** data using Excel

## What are we assessing?

This assessment is a simplified example of the type of work you'll be doing at GetQuorum on a regular basis. Our customers provide us with multiple data files during the onboarding process. One of your responsibilities will be to **clean** and **merge** the data into a format that our system can accept.

_Disclaimer: All data used in this test was mocked using a random data generator. Any relation to real world data would be by pure coincidence_
